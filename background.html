					<h5 class="anti"># A History of Sludge</h5>
					<p>
						It all started many many years ago when a little boy and his sister were wandering at some desolate festival 
						and out of nowhere heard some Black Sabbath-like tunes. They decided to take a look, 
						it was a very impressive <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Thee+Plague+Of+Gentlemen" target="_blank">Thee Plague Of Gentlemen</a> playing.
						Not much later the ‘<a href="http://www.discogs.com/Various-Dreams-Of-What-Life-Could-Have-Been/release/871199" target="_blank">Dreams Of What Life Could Have Been</a>’-compilation came into his life 
						and the little boy got completely sold to this genre of music.<br />
						Nobody can remember how he got to know <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/M%C3%B6se" target="_blank">Möse</a> but anyway he booked them to play for a handful of locals in a youth center. 
						They had a chat and gave him a free copy of a <a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/4210286" target="_blank">sampler/compilation</a>.
						Whilst skimming this sampler/compilation at his humble home, he had his first encounter with the term "Doom It Yourself" 
						and saw it popping up more and more as time went by (<a href="http://www.empress-metal-magazine.de/?p=552" target="_blank">article</a> on HDDT, name of <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Gura" target="_blank">Gura</a>'s latest <a href="http://www.discogs.com/label/Doom+It+Yourself" target="_blank">record label</a>, etc).<br />
						Which, relying on its context, convinced him it was the right name for a world changing project.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="big section">
					<h5 class="anti"># Do-It-Yourself</h5>
					<p>
						Since the 80’s hardcore punk bands from all over the world have been able to tour
						and release material through an international DIY network.
						This network is made out of musicians, bands, concert promoters and record producers/studios
						in which favors are exchanged instead of monetary payment,
						which has resulted into an independent, vibrant and more pure musical environment.
						<br />
						Lately this mindset has been extended to even larger projects.
						A Danish association (<a href="http://heavydaysindoomtown.com/?page_id=30" target="_blank">UMF</a>) has organized two years in a row successful festivals based on DIY ethics.
						<br />
						The purpose of Doom-It-Yourself is to organize a similar project in Belgium.
						In practice this will mean that bands will perform in exchange for
						a place to sleep, food, drinks and the transportation costs.
						The performances will be held over at multiple venues/squats sympathetic to our idea,
						like <a href="http://www.kraak.net/" target="_blank">KRAAK</a> has been doing in Belgium for so many years.
						<br />
						The project is entirely based on the work of volunteers,
						which will subsequently mean that profits will be invested into upcoming projects.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="big section">
					<h5 class="anti"># Goal</h5>
					<p>
						Support the local underground scene as well as help underground bands abroad reach an audience beyond its national borders.
						<br />
						To provide everything a poor man needs during war; from cultural events to recipes for healthy food and homemade machinery.
						<br />
						Molded in an online community for real-life actions.
						<br />
						&#9654; entirely volunteer-run
						<br />
						&#9654; the audience is young
						<br />
						&#9654; very wide-ranging topics (security, politics, activism, lockpicking)
						<br />
						&#9654; a really nice mood
						<br />
						&#9654; great marketing and press cooperation
						<br />
						<q>see our <a href="http://wiki.doomityourself.org/Roadmap" target="_blank">roadmap</a> for a complete list of goals and more information.</q>

					<h5 class="anti"># Corporate Music Industry</h5>
					<p>
						In the days where so-called ‘alternative’ venues are owned by multinational sharks like MTV,
						where music festivals (of which many originally were meant as a protest against corporate culture)
						are now hosted by Rich Uncle Pennybags, the need for underground counter-culture continues to grow.
						<br />
						With the recent government cuts in the cultural budget the underground music scene in Belgium has suffered casualties.
						This setback has left us with a need to look into different ideas to grow. This while being more self-reliant at the same time.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h5 class="anti"># Community</h5>
					<p>
						There are countless ways in which a company can screw up their “community”.
						<br />
						And so far, most having a terrible track record when it comes to communication,
						multiple delays and broken promises, and just being clueless about how to properly interact with
						the “real” world generally speaking, or releasing info only to a select few insiders&hellip;
						<br />
						All that without foreseeing the harm it would do to their already strained relationship with the public?
						That’s just pitiful—and terribly far from 
						<a href="http://www.kraak.net/" target="_blank">Kraak</a>, 
						<a href="http://heavydaysindoomtown.com/?page_id=30" target="_blank">UMF</a>, 
						<a href="http://www.mangenerated.com/" target="_blank">mangenerated</a>, 
						<a href="http://www.trektuwplant.be/" target="_blank">TrektUwPlant</a>, 
						<a href="http://www.incubate.org/" target="_blank">Incubate</a>
						and all the others whose commitment has occurred fully in the community from the start.
					</p>

				<div class="big section">
					<h5 class="anti"># Open-Source Project</h5>
					<p>
						An open-source project/ecosystem is not about throwing together a pile of code and
						slapping a copyleft license on top of it.
						It’s about a superior software development model (given equal manpower)
						where you foster reuse and collaboration with other open-source projects.
						It is about being a living cell of an organism, an active part of an ecosystem.
						<br />
						When you contribute to open-source projects that have been doing things “the open-source way”
						(that is: depending on shared libraries and contributing to them—be it testing or providing fixes upstream),
						you end up fostering the use and improvement of the technologies that are the heart and soul of
						your open-source desktop/operating system.
						<br />
						In the long run, you end up improving widgets, frameworks, engines, libraries, icon themes and artwork&hellip;
						the list goes on.
						<br />
						You don't have to worry about screwed up licensing, too much control over the direction of the project,
						copyright assignment clauses, “read-only” sources, etc.
						<br />
						Now consider this: the open-source concept doesn’t have to just apply to software.
						It can apply to anything in life, any area where information is currently in the hands of few instead of many,
						any area where a few people control the production and distribution and improvement of a product or service or entity.
						<br />
						Open-source is helping of the community, instead of government welfare.

				<div class="section">
					<h5 class="anti"># Green Policy</h5>
					<p>
						In 2013, we will strive to be even greener than before!
						<br />
						If you feel us on this policy and you want to be a part of the -not to say- our solution,
						feel free to do so. Maybe you're the one who has that excellent idea regarding this matter to make our event the greenest one so far.
						Don't hesistate to communicate it to us, because all big efforts were once small brain sensations in someone's weird head.
						You must know that your splendid example could be followed by many others and even become the standard.
						<br />
						In meantime we really hope all of you take our earlier ideas out and introduce them to other events, friends, your family, at home, everywhere, it’s a small world after all&hellip;
						<br />
						And we need to take care of it
						<br />
						Right fucking NOW !!!
