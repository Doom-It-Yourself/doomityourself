				<h3 class="gryz">&#9650; Some introduction</h3>
				<h5 class="anti"># Corporate Music Industry</h5>
				<p>
					In the days where so-called ‘alternative’ venues are owned by multinational sharks like MTV, 
					where music festivals (of which many originally were meant as a protest against corporate culture) 
					are now hosted by Rich Uncle Pennybags, the need for underground counter-culture continues to grow. 
					<br />
					With the recent government cuts in the cultural budget the underground music scene in Belgium has suffered casualties. 
					This setback has left us with a need to look into different ideas to grow. This while being more self-reliant at the same time.
				</p>
				<h5 class="anti"># Do-It-Yourself</h5>
				<p>
					Since the 80’s hardcore punk bands from all over the world have been able to tour 
					and release material through an international DIY network. 
					This network is made out of musicians, bands, concert promoters and record producers/studios 
					in which favors are exchanged instead of monetary payment. 
					This has resulted into an independent, vibrant and more pure musical environment.
					<br />
					Lately this mindset has been extended to even larger projects.
					A Danish association (UMF) has organized two years in a row successful festivals based on DIY ethics.
					<br /> 
					The purpose of Doom-It-Yourself is to organize a similar project in Belgium. 
					In practice this will mean that bands will perform in exchange for 
					a place to sleep, food, drinks and the transportation costs. 
					The performances will be held over at multiple venues/squats sympathetic to our idea, 
					like KRAAK has been doing in Belgium for so many years.
					<br />
					The project is entirely based on the work of volunteers, 
					this subsequently means that profits will be invested into upcoming projects.
				</p>
				<h5 class="anti"># Goal</h5>
				<p>
					Support the local underground scene as well as help underground bands abroad reach an audience beyond its national borders.
					<br />
					To provide everything a poor man needs during war; from cultural events to recipes for healthy food and homemade machinery.
					<br />
					Molted in an online community for real-life actions.
					<br />
					&#9654; entirely volunteer-run
					<br />
					&#9654; the audience is young
					<br />
					&#9654; very wide-ranging topics (security, politics, activism, lockpicking)
					<br />
					&#9654; international high-caliber varied talks
					<br />
					&#9654; a really nice mood
					<br />
					&#9654; great marketing and press cooperation
					<br />
					&#9654; working live streams of every talk
					<br />
					&#9654; every talk in a foreign talk live-translated into English
					<br />
					&#9654; videos available on Vimeo and via FTP on the same day
					<br />

				</p>
				<h5 class="anti"># Community</h5>
				<p>
					there are countless ways in which a company can screw up their “community”. 
					<br />
					And so far, most having a terrible track record when it comes to communication, 
					multiple delays and broken promises, and just being clueless about how to properly interact with 
					the “real” world generally speaking, or releasing info only to a select few insiders&hellip;
					<br />
					All that without foreseeing the harm it would do to their already strained relationship with the public? 
					That’s just pitiful—and terribly far from Kraak, UMF, mangenerated, TrektUwPlant, Incubate
					and all the others whose commitment has occurred fully in the community from the start.
				</p>
				<h5 class="anti"># Open-Source Project</h5>
				<p>
					An open-source project is not about throwing together a pile of code and 
					slapping a copyleft license on top of it. 
					It’s about a superior software development model (given equal manpower) 
					where you foster reuse and collaboration with other open-source projects. 
					It is about being a living cell of an organism, an active part of an ecosystem.
					<br />
					When you contribute to open-source projects that have been doing things “the open-source way” 
					(that is: depending on shared libraries and contributing to them—be it testing or providing fixes upstream), 
					you end up fostering the use and improvement of the technologies that are the heart and soul of 
					your open-source desktop/operating system.
					<br />
					In the long run, you end up improving widgets, frameworks, engines, libraries, icon themes and artwork&hellip;
					the list goes on.
					<br />
					You don't have to worry about screwed up licensing, too much control over the direction of the project, 
					copyright assignment clauses, “read-only” sources, etc.
				</p>
				<h5 class="anti"># Green Policy</h5>
				<p>
					In 2013, we will strive to be even greener than before!
					<br />
					If you feel us on this policy and you want to be a part of the -not to say- our solution, 
					feel free to do so. Maybe you're the one who has that excellent idea regarding this matter to make our event the greenest one so far. 
					Don't hesistate to communicate it to us, because all big efforts were once small brain sensations in someone's weird head. 
					You must know that your splendid example could be followed by many others and even become the standard.
					<br />
					In meantime we really hope all of you take our earlier ideas out and introduce them to other events, friends, your family, at home, everywhere, it’s a small world after all&hellip;
					<br />
					And we need to take care of it
					<br />
					Right fucking NOW !!!
