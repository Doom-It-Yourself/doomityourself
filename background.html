				<h3 class="gryz">&#9650; Some introduction</h3>
				<h5 class="anti"># Corporate Music Industry</h5>
				<p>
					In the days where so-called ‘alternative’ venues are owned by multinational sharks like MTV, 
					where music festivals (of which many originally were meant as a protest against corporate culture) 
					are now hosted by Rich Uncle Pennybags, the need for underground counter-culture continues to grow. 
					<br />
					With the recent government cuts in the cultural budget the underground music scene in Belgium has suffered casualties. 
					This setback has left us with a need to look into different ideas to grow. This while being more self-reliant at the same time.
				</p>
				<h5 class="anti"># Do-It-Yourself</h5>
				<p>
					Since the 80’s hardcore punk bands from all over the world have been able to tour 
					and release material through an international DIY network. 
					This network is made out of musicians, bands, concert promoters and record producers/studios 
					in which favors are exchanged instead of monetary payment. 
					This has resulted into an independent, vibrant and more pure musical environment. 
					Lately this mindset has been extended to even larger projects. 
					A Danish association (UMF) has organized two years in a row successful festivals based on DIY ethics. 
					The purpose of Doom-It-Yourself is to organize a similar project in Belgium. 
					In practice this will mean that bands will perform in exchange for 
					a place to sleep, food, drinks and the transportation costs. 
					The performances will be held over at multiple venues/squats sympathetic to our idea, 
					like KRAAK has been doing in Belgium for so many years. 
					The project is entirely based on the work of volunteers, 
					this subsequently means that profits will be invested into upcoming projects. 
					Our goal is to support the local underground scene 
					as well as help underground bands abroad reach an audience beyond its national borders.
				</p>
				<h5 class="anti"># goal</h5>
				<p>
					To provide everything a poor man needs during war; from cultural events to recipes for healthy food and homemade machinery.
				</p>
				<h5 class="anti"># open source</h5>
				<p>
					- copy some text about use in theory and practical from virtual to real life
				</p>
				<h5 class="anti"># Green Policy</h5>
				<p>
					In 2013, we will strive to be even greener than before!
					<br />
					If you feel us on this policy and you want to be a part of the -not to say- our solution, 
					feel free to do so. Maybe you're the one who has that excellent idea regarding this matter to make our event the greenest one so far. 
					Don't hesistate to communicate it to us, because all big efforts were once small brain sensations in someone's weird head. 
					You must know that your splendid example could be followed by many others and even become the standard.
					<br />
					In meantime we really hope all of you take our earlier ideas out and introduce them to other events, friends, your family, at home, everywhere, … it’s a small world after all ... and we need to take care of it ... right fucking NOW !!!
