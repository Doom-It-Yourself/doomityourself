				<h3>Dear fellowship of freak brothers,</h3>

				<p>
					The problem with music these days is the commercial shit, right?
					<br>
					The goddamn head-up-yr-ass cheesy weak brainless pathetic middle-class high-school glamour meth whores. And when you try to put some loud music on to kill the pain brought upon you by this shallow society the police come bashing in and...
					<br>
					Euhm wait...
				</p>

				<p>
					We actually wanted to make the following announcement;
					<br>
					We are very thrilled to introduce you to a new platform against commerce, against endorphin!
				</p>

				<p>
					Are you also fed up with the lack of anything that can accompany you on a murderous strange day? Then this might be something for you!
					<br>
					This is an attempt to do something different and meaningful; a platform for anti-commercial culture. Powered by napalm and muddy drugfreak volunteers.
					<br>
					That in it self might not be that innovative, but it's an experiment with the implentation of DIY ideas and organizational methods onto new genres and artforms in the hope that this will inspire and create new platforms for non-commercial culture like <a href="http://heavydaysindoomtown.com/" target="_blank">hddt</a> did for us.
					<br>
					What we think is innovative of this platform is the approach to involve opensource and it's community to this way of organizing. So that everybody can learn and contribute change.
					<br>
					We also think it's important to give more attention to subcultures. Dark times make possibilities so let's come together to make our mission possible.
				</p>
