				<h3>Get in touch</h3>
				<p>
					Join the mailinglist and make some noise on our freenode irc channel #doomed-it-dev!
				</p>

				<h3>Important note for pull requests</h3>
				<p>
					Pull requests should be issued against the develop branch. We never pull directly into master.
					<br />
					Our goal is to iterate in small steps. Release often, release early. Evolution instead of a revolution.
				</p>

				<h3>General goals</h3>
				<p>
					To make sure everybody is going in the same direction:
					<br />
					* easy to use for people
					<br />
					* using less resources
					<br />
					* extendable with plugins
					<br />
					* keep it maintainable
				</p>

				<h3>How to work with git?</h3>
				<p>
					* Don't work in your master branch.
					<br />
					* Make a new branch for every feature you are working on.
					<br />
					* Don't use the online edit function of github.
					<br />
					* Try to make clean commits that are easy readable (including descriptive commit messages).
					<br />
					* Test before you push.
					<br />
					* Make small pull requests that are easy to review but make sure they do add value individually.
				</p>

				<h3>Coding style</h3>
				<p>
					* Do write comments.
					<br />
					* Indentation: CSS: 2 spaces; HTML: 4 spaces (= 1 tab)
					<br />
					* Don't overengineer.
					<br />
					* Do generalize sooner then later.
					<br />
					* If you do make changes, document them. (see below)
				</p>

				<h3>Branching model / git workflow</h3>
				<p>
					Over the time we pull features from feature branches into the develop branch.
					Every month we pull from develop into master. Bugs in master get fixed in hotfix branches.
					These branches will get merged into master and develop.
					There should never be commits in master that aren't in develop.
					<br />
					Also see <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">git workflow</a>
					<br />
					# <code>
						master</code>
					<strong>branch</strong>
					<br />
					* This is the (stable) branch everyone should use for production stuff
					<br />
					# <code>
						develop</code>
					<strong>branch</strong>
					<br />
					* Everything that is tested and ready to go into master at some point in time
					<br />
					# <code>
						release</code>
					<strong>branch</strong>
					<br />
					* Only bugfixes go into these
					<br />
					# <code>
						hotfix</code>
					<strong>branch</strong>
					<br />
					* Fixes for bugs in master
					<br />
					# <code>
						feature</code>
					<strong>branch</strong> (in your own repos)
					<br />
					* These are the branches where you develop your features in
