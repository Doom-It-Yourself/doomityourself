### open
+ move from google to real/true open source services/projects

+ find github-like services for audio (soundkeep) and images
+ use [microdata](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/links.html#microdata) for better search results and semantic markup.
+ make ascii version of logo for cowsay art
+ collect quotes (from fortune -so) for fortune-doom
+ migrate to jekyll+markdown
+ start concepts for hardware design (on upventer)
+ add bbs and (maybe integrated with) diaspora pod
