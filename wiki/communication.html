					Useful tips from our Q&amp;A with the community<sup>[1]</sup>.
				</p>

				<h3># Contact with <a href="fellows.html#nikolaj">Nikolaj</a> (HDDT)</h3>
				<p>
					Q: Do you have any tips, hints, recommendations and other wisdom for us?
				</p>
				<p>
					A: The biggest and most important tip i can give you would be: work hard, be ambitious, and gather a group of likeminded people who are willing to give everything to make the best possible result.
					<br />
					Its very different from country to country what is possible to make happen. For examble we have alot of great venues that are very easy to deal with, and we were able to fund raise a lot of money to fly in bands. It is deffintetly not everywhere that is possible, so first step would be to find venues/squats that woulsd be into the idea.
					<br />
					Next step is the money issue. its expensive as shit to fly in 30 bands from all over, and we got 30.000 euros from fundraising, and sold tickets for 25.000 euros.
					<br />
					So make a realistic budget with how many money you have, and how many money you would be able to get from ticket sales.
					<br />
					Then promotion is very important! we contacted some amazing artists who put in 100s of hours in making the graphical design that we could put on flyers, and then we made 5000 posters and 20.000 flyers and send them everywhere.
					<br />
					And to distribution we made use of our partners. We wrote a bunch of labels, festivals etc and asked them if they would be our official partner. and since we are DIY, there is no commercial agreement to that deal. we simply help eachother.
					<br />
					A last thing that comes to mind is, dont be afraid asking bands you think would never play for free. Alot of them actually will, and the ones who doesnt, fuck them. They can go play somewhere else.
					<br />
					Just contact me whenever if you need help or advise, i totally support other people who wants to do the same thing as us!!!!
