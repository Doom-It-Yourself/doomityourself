							Q: Do you have any
							tips, hints, recommendations and other wisdom for us?
						</p>
						<p class="drop">
							A: The biggest and most important tip I can give you would be: work hard, be ambitious
							and gather a group of like minded people who are willing to give everything to make the best possible result.
							<br />
							It is very different from country to country what is possible to make happen. For example
							we have a lot of great venues that are very easy to deal with, and we were able to fund
							raise a lot of money to fly in bands. That is definitely not everywhere possible,
							so first step would be to find venues/squats that would be into the idea.
							<br />
							Next step is the money issue. It is expensive as shit to fly in 30 bands from all over,
							we got 30.000 euro from fundraising and sold tickets for 25.000 euro.
							<br />
							So make a realistic budget with how many money you have and how many money you would
							be able to get from ticket sales.
							<br />
							Then promotion is very important! We contacted some amazing artists who put in hundreds of
							hours in making the graphical design that we could put on flyers. And then we made 5000
							posters and 20.000 flyers to send everywhere.
							<br />
							And for distribution we made use of our partners. We wrote a bunch of labels, festivals etc
							and asked them if they would be our official partner. Since we are DIY, there is no
							commercial agreement to that deal, we simply help each other.
							<br />
							A last thing that comes to mind is, don't be afraid asking bands you think would never
							play for free. A lot of them actually will, and the ones who don't, fuck them. They can go play somewhere else.
							<br />
							Just contact me whenever you need help or advise, I totally support other people who
							want to do the same thing as us!!!!
